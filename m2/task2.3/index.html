<p><em>Task 2.3</em>
<br>
<strong><em>AWS</em></strong></p>

<p>Hi! I am Anatolii and this is my report for Task 2.3 of the EPAM Kharkiv DevOps course (KhNURE group).</p>
<br>
<p>In this practical task i've learned about free tier of AWS (Amazon Web Services) and it's basic functionality - EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) and pre-defined machines on it (WordPress website), S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) and using of CLI AWS.
<br>
Everything could be done with your pinky finger.</p>

<p>So move on to the practice.</p>

<br>
<p>First of all i've created an Linux Virtual Machine with CentOS 6 as operation system, checked it's access policies and connected to the VM.</p>
<p>Second step - setup the S3 and upload / retrieve files from it. There was no any difficulties, so this was pretty easy.</p>
<p>Next step - create WordPress website. This is almost like first part of the task, but with some changes.</p>
<p>First i've selected a template which is ready for launching WordPress website out-of-box.</p>

<br>
<p>Then after all instance setup and booting it up needed to check logs to get admin access to the WordPress control panel.</p>

<br>
<p>After it you have all the access to the website.</p>
<p>AWS also could be used as Domain Name Registrar, so all work with website could be done from a single place.</p>
<p>Final step in the task - use CLI to control S3 bucket.</p>
<p>First - setting up initial configuration. Second step - create new bucket.</p>

<br>
<p>After this i can upload / download (with some errors) / remove files from the S3 using CLI.</p>

<p>As general result of work - small (and bad) one page website, which is hosted by S3 and GitHub.</p>
